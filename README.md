# Shy's Dashboard

Shy's dashboard is a dashboard built for the [shy discord bot](https://github.com/shydiscord/shy) ecosystem. It plans to provide an easy and intuitive way for configuring the bot's capabilities, while also providing an alternative platform for the bot's key functionalities.

Shy's Dashboard uses Vue.js for its front-end functionality and Flask for the back-end. This is so that the developer(s) of the platform can further enhance their understandings of both Python Web Development, JavaScript and the Vue.js web-framework. It is by no means a efficient or logical way of doing things, and there will more than likely be drawbacks.
